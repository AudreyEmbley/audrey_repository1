      	<p>Ada Lovelace was the daughter of <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/lord-byron">Lord Byron</a>, 
      	a poet and terrible father. Fearing Lovelace would follow in her father’s footsteps, Lady Byron immersed her 
        in mathematics. Lady Byron, herself a mathematical wiz called “Princess of Parallelograms” 
        by Lord Byron, believed a rigorous course of study rooted in logic and reason would enable 
        her daughter to avoid the romantic ideals and moody nature of her father. From the age of 
        4, Lovelace was tutored in mathematics and science, an unusual course of study for a woman 
        in 19th-century England. Fortunately, Lovelace loved mathematics. At the age of 12, Lovelace 
        conceptualized a flying machine. After studying the anatomy of birds 
        and the suitability of various materials, the young girl illustrated plans to construct a winged 
        flying apparatus before moving on to think about powered flight. She was a visionary who predicted 
        that computer could do more than just crunch numbers. Lovelace

       	foresaw the multi-purpose functionality of the modern computer. Although <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> 
       	believed the use of	his machines was confined to numerical calculations, she mused that any piece of content—including music, 
       	text, pictures and sounds—could be translated to digital form and manipulated by machine. Lovelace’s 
       	ideas about computing were so far ahead of their time that it took nearly a century for technology to catch up.</p>

        	<li>wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only
        	on paper</li>

        	<li>During the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Defense developed a high-order computer programming language 
        	to supersede the hundreds of different ones then in use by the military. When U.S. Navy Commander Jack 
        	Cooper suggested naming the new language “Ada” in honor of Lovelace in 1979, the proposal was unanimously 
        	approved. Ada is still used around the world today in the operation of real-time systems in the aviation, 
        	health care, transportation, financial, infrastructure and space industries.</li>
