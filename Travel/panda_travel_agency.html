		Ephesus, Turkey is a beautiful place to look at ancient Greek ruins. As you can see in
		the picture, they are massive! Ephesus is located on a very fertile valley. The ancient Roman city is 
		believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake, but now it's a beautiful ancient Roman City!</p>

		<p><font size="4">The house of The Virgin Mary is located 4 kilometers away on top of the Bulbul Mountain overlooking Ephesus, Selcuk and the Aegean Sea. 
		Thanks to the visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich, the shrine was discovered by priests from nearby Izmir city who were inspired by the book of Clemens 
		Brentano who met with Anne Catherine and published her visions. You can beat the crowds if you go there close to the lunch time since buses flock the shrine 
		in the morning.</p>

		<p><font size="4">Every year, thousands of tourists use the harbor to reach Ephesus after their cruises in the Greek Islands and you can easily catch a ferry 
		to Samos island and combine your Turkey trip with the Greek Islands. The center of the city is full of nice restaurants and cafes with stunning views of the 
		Turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea. I highly recommend you to finish your day watching the sun going down over the ocean with your loved ones and a cold beverage.</p>
