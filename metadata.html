	<p style="font-size:27"><b>Welcome to the Flamin' Cheetos Information Page!</b> Here you will learn more about Flamin' Cheetos than you ever thought you would!</p>
	
	<p style="font-size:20">Flamin' Cheetos were invented by Richard Monta√±ez, a former janitor for a Frito-Lay Rancho Cucamonga plant in California. One day, a machine broke
	 in the assembly line, causing some Cheetos to not get dusted with the bright orange cheese powder, so Richard took some home and put chili powder on them. He created his 
	 own recipe for a spicier version of Cheetos that was inspired by a Mexican street snack called elote. Now he is the executive vice president of multicultural sales and 
	 community activation for PepsiCo's North American divisions. Thanks to him, we have this delicious snack!</p>
	 
	 <p style="font-size:20">If you think Flamin' Cheetos are too messy, there is a way to get around that! You can eat them with chopsticks. It's easy, and mess-free!
